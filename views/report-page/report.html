        Create a Web tool for flexible visualization of data on actor
        nominations for the last years at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards
        via its own developed REST / GraphQL API. Additional information on each
        actor and film production can be accessed from The Movie Database
        (TMDb). The statistics and views generated - at least 3 ways - can be
        exported in CSV, WebP and SVG formats. The system will also provide
        support for the news access regarding each nominee, based on external
        data sources configurable within the developed application.

          in Node.js and MongoDB was chosen for the database, using MVC
          architecture and at the client level, the HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
          were used. The site design was made in Figma and the interface is
          intuitive, and all pages are responsive, the components changing their
          size, shape or page layout depending on the device used, for a
          flawless navigation.

          created a design in Figma to know exactly what we would love our site
          to look like for catching the eye from the first glance.

        Initially we set the design, the color palette and what the interface
        should look like in the user interaction with the website. Github was
        chosen as the source code management system, where there were many
        commits given the division of the application into many submodules and
        tasks.
